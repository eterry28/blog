# Comrade Cola – Oppress Your Thirst!

First of all, I had one of the weirdest dreams after reading 1984, World War Z, and the latest from the In Death series. Not in one sitting mind you. As a result, a completely fictitious company was born – The Comrade Cola Company. Orwellian due to its size and influence. Brooksian because there is something sinister lingering beneath the surface. Robbian in its futuristic setting and charismatic cast of characters.

This company will serve as our client, headed by Ms. C, with never-ending changes. Here, I will show my-world examples of how we can use different coding languages to solve them. Let’s play with JavaScript (TypeScript), PHP, C#, Python and Java. The most noteworthy take away here is to use the right tool for the job.
