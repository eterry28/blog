First of all, I had one of the weirdest dreams after reading 1984, World War Z, and the latest from the In Death series. Not in one sitting. As a result, a completely fictitious company was born – The Comrade Cola Company.

This company will serve as our client with never-ending wants. Here, I will show my-world examples of how we can use different coding languages to solve them. I will stick to PHP and JavaScript (TypeScript), but who knows. I may throw in some C#, Python or Java. The most noteworthy take away here is to use the right tool for the job.

The Chairman of the company wants to become a major player in the food and beverage industry. Therefore, our crew has been “hired” to help make his want a reality. The Chairman expresses his dream of making ice-cold Comrade Cola available to the masses.
