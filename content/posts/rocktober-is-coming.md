I gave myself a bit of a challenge in 2021. No doubt you have seen monthly list like #Inktober or #NaNoWriMo. For me, it was #Rocktober. This kid from the hood spent 31 consecutive days linking out to some October/Halloween inspired rock songs. I must say, it was a great success for me. I am constantly pushing my boundaries for growth.

I listen to a bit of rock or metal here and there, but this is by far the most I have listened to in one month. There were plenty of great songs that did not make the list. I guess that gives me a head start for the years to come.

Enough of the jibba-jabba! Letâ€™s get to some songs!
